In the video the LEDs light up according to the current value of the LED register. When the code hits the timer_isr interrupt, the r3 register (the register holding the current values of the LEDs) is incremented by 1. This is how the LEDs light up, as they correspond to the value of the register in binary. For example, when the value of r3 is 5, LEDR2 and LEDR0 will be lit up on the board.
